```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("wdi.csv")
df.head()

selected = df[[
    "inflation_rate",
    "gdp_growth_rate",
    "unemployment_rate"
]]
selected.describe()

## We see that GDP growth rate is positively correlated with inflation rate. This is because inflation rate is a part of GDP growth rate. To find the real GDP growth rate, we need to substract the inflation rate. Countries with high unemployment rates also tend to have higher inflation rate.

```{python}
#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: "Inflation vs GDP"
#| echo: false
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(
    df["inflation_rate"],
    df["gdp_growth_rate"]
)
plt.xlabel("Inflation Rate")
plt.ylabel("GDP Growth Rate")
plt.title("Inflation rate vs GDP Growth Rate")
plt.show()

top5 = df.sort_values(
    "unemployment_rate",
    ascending=False
).head(5)

#| label: fig-2
#| fig-cap: "Inflation Rate of Countries with Highest Unemployment Rates"
plt.figure()
plt.bar(top5["country"],
        top5["inflation_rate"])
plt.xlabel("Country")
plt.ylabel("Inflation Rate")
plt.title("Inflation Rate of Countries with Highest Unemployment Rates")
plt.show()
```
## The first figure illustrates the relationship between Inflation and GDP. The second figure illustrates the inflation rate of countries with high unemployment rate. Source: WDI Dataset 2022

```{python}
#| label: tbl-summary
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Summary"
selected.describe()
vars = df[[
    "inflation_rate",
    "gdp_growth_rate",
    "unemployment_rate"
]]

vars.describe()
```

## @fig-1-1 shows the relationship between inflation rate and GDP Growth Rate.
## @fig-1-2 shows the inflation rate of countries with highest unemployment rates.
## @tbl-summary is a summary of all the information we are analyzing.
